        <span>Hyper Text Markup Language. Huh, i think you already knew. So what?😏 So, first lets' see some basics.</span>
        <span>Basically, it's used to define the strictures of the website with the help of CSS which we are going to learn after this. It was created by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau woth their friends in 1989</span>
        <span>Latest versionis HTML5. </span>
        <h2 className={Style.heading}>Some Basic keywords to know😉 => </h2>
        <span><b>Tags</b> are like building blocks for HTML. Eg. div, span, input. If you open any website/page in dev mode, you'll see lots of these tags in 'Elements" tab/</span>
        <span><b>Attributes</b> are like some additional data passed to any tag which can be retrievedand used to perform some functionality</span>
        <h2 className={Style.heading}>Prerequisites😯</h2>
        <span>Dont worry, you just install any <b>BROWSER</b> and an editor and stay with us. I personally use <b>VS Code</b> as editor but hey, If you dont have any editor then you can use Notepad as well for HTML.</span>
        <span>Dont have that also😑, we got your back, you can use following editor to play with HTML for sometime...😀</span>
        <Editor />
      </div>
